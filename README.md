# Hackathon
The Project for our Hackathon

Made by Daniel Ye(moi), Shane Chen, Sharmin Dabidiyan and Pradyumn Jha

## What is this project? 
It's a covid simulator/town controlling game

The player controls a variety of humans who go about their lives in a small city. Alas, there is a COVID virus in the town! 
It's up to you to code behavior into the characters so that the risk and transmission is reduced!
